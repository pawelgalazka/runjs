Minimalistic building tool


## Get started

Install globally (for a command line script):

    npm install runjs -g

Install in your project (to use runjs api inside your `runfile.js`):

    npm install runjs --save-dev

If you want to use Babel (6.x) install it. Runjs will pickup
babel-register automatically.

    npm install babel-core babel-preset-es2015 babel-register --save-dev

Configure Babel in your package.json:

    "babel": {
      "presets": ["es2015"]
    }

Create runfile.js:

```javascript

import {run} from 'runjs';

const task = {
    'create:component': (name) => {

    },
    'build:js': () => {
      run('webpack -p --config config/webpack/prod.js --progress');
    },
    'build:css': () => {

    },
    'build': () => {
      task['build:js']();
      task['build:css']();
    }
};

export default task
```
    
Run:
```
run create:component AppContainer
run build:js
run build
```

Tips:

* `./node_modules/.bin/` is included into PATH when running commands by `run` api method
* executing `run` command without arguments displays list of all available tasks
* each call of exported functions is logged to console as well as commands called by `run` method
* you don't have to use Babel. If runjs not finds `babel-register` it will
fallback to pure node for your `runfile.js`
* if you use babel and you would like to RunJS perform better it
is advised to use npm version >3.0 (better performance with loading
many modules which is a case for Babel plugins)
    
If you have a very specific location for your `babel-register`, you can define
a path to it through config (default is `./node_modules/babel-register`):

    "runjs": {
        "babel-register": "./node_modules/some_package/node_modules/babel-register"
    }

## Why runjs ?

We have Grunt, Gulp, npm scripts, Makefile. Why another building tool ?

Gulp or Grunt files seem overly complex for what they do and the plugin
ecosystem adds a layer of complexity towards the simple command
line tools underneath. The documentation is not always up to date
and the plugin does not always use the latest version of the tool.
After a while customizing the process even with simple things,
reconfiguring it becomes time consuming.

Npm scripts are simple but they get out of hand pretty quickly if
we need more complex process which make them quite hard to read.

Makefiles are simple, better for more complex processes
but they depend on bash scripting. Within `runfile` you can use
command line calls as well as JavaScript code and npm
libraries which makes that approach much more flexible. Additionally 
each task and command call is reported in the console.

## API

```javascript
import {run, generate} from 'runjs';
```

**run(cmd, options)**

run given command as a child process and log the call in the output

Options:

```javascript
{
    cwd: .., // current working directory (String)
    async: ... // run command asynchronously (true/false)
    stdio: ... // 'inherit' (default), 'pipe' or 'ignore'
    env: ...
    timeout: ...
}
```

Examples:

```javascript
run('rm -rf ./build')
run('http-server .', {async: true}).then((output) => {
  log(output) 
}).catch((error) => {
  throw error
})
```

**generate(src, dst, context)**

generate file specified by `dst` path by given template `src` and `context`

`file1.tmp.js`:
```javascript
{
    author: '<%= AUTHOR %>'
}
```

```javascript
generate('file1.tmp.js', 'file1.js', {AUTHOR: 'Pawel'});
```

will generate `file1.js`:

```
{
    author: 'Pawel'
}
```
